In this challenge the user is given 10 inputs that they are able to type in through postman. Once they have all 10 inputs their inputs will then be displayed in a story through postman.

First the will push F5 so that is debugs the code and makes sure the code is running, they will then get the local host url and paste it into postman so that the dated is being transferred to postman.
        Local Host                  Controller      Route
Example: https://localhost:7228/GreaterThanLessThan/greatorless

Peer reviewed by: Brandon Le - Mad Lib worked properly and all inputs linked to the correct part of the story. There were some spacing issues that he will fix and other than that it works well and also the story is fun and creative. Good job overall! I liked how his inputs were not in the URL. Very cool.
